# Abstract
In this paper we study the effects of radiation derived from image diagnostics related to the cell...

Manuna et al. showed in previous work that the hypothesis presented could make sense...

No modelling works has been done until now that reflect the type of reserach conducted in this project.

# Simulations
We simulate using LAMMPS software the impact of mild radiation in the DNA chains inside the cell. We use NVT collectivity and Nos√©-Hoover integration protocol.

# Methodology
We did some experiments and compared the results with the simulations, using the latter to try and explain the mechanisms too. Then we compared them to the simulations done by Zoferin. 

# Results
In this work we found out that the correlation between the mild radiation and thelong term consequences of other radiation is non conclusive. 

# Figures
Figures will be placed in their own section.

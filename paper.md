# Abstract
In this paper we study the effects of radiation derived from image diagnostics related to the cell...

Manuna et al. showed in previous work that the hypothesis presented could make sense...

No modelling works has been done until now that reflect the type of reserach conducted in this project.

# Simulations
We simulate using LAMMPS software the impact of mild radiation in the DNA chains inside the cell.
